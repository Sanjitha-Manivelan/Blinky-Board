## 11/3/2025 - Made Schematic  

I finished making the Schematic for the blinky board, and I ran into a lot of problems, like the red dots not showing up because. put the wire too far or not being able to delete a messed-up wire. However, after a while, I started to understand how to do it.![Screenshot 2025-11-03 at 4.13.04 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODE5NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e93d9e290043472d04541cb6dfeb28eeaba51d2e/Screenshot%202025-11-03%20at%204.13.04%E2%80%AFPM.png)
